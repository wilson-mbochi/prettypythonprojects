Hi there!
Thank you for your interest. I have been passively learning Python programming via Eric Matthes Python Crash Course book. See website here: https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/
Lately I've decided to be more resourceful by utilizing AI tools ie chatGPT and CoPilot to aid my learning and be more productive. Eventually these programs will be more complex and hopefully still pretty :)
