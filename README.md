Hi there!
Thank you for your interest. I have been passively learning Python programming via Eric Matthes Python Crash Course book. See website here: https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/
Lately I've decided to be more resourceful by utilizing AI tools ie chatGPT and CoPilot to aid my learning and be more productive.
